#Project Overview

FurniAR provides an interactive and educational experience by allowing users to visualize furniture items in real-time through AR. The app uses image recognition to detect furniture items (e.g., beds, chairs, sofas, flower vases) and displays corresponding 3D models. This immersive approach is beneficial for both educational and practical applications, particularly in interior design.

#Features

- Furniture Recognition: Identifies various furniture items using image processing.
- 3D Model Visualization: Displays 3D models of recognized furniture in the AR environment.
- User Engagement: Offers an interactive, immersive experience for exploring furniture designs.
- Educational Content: Provides detailed information about each furniture itemâ€™s design and features.

#Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/BARATH-NAGARAJ/FURNITURE-AR-VR.git
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Make sure to install Vuforia Engine for AR functionality.
4. Build and run the app on a compatible mobile device with AR support.

#Usage
11. Launch the app and use the camera to scan furniture items.
2. The app will identify the item and display a 3D model in real-time AR.
3. Users can interact with the model to explore different furniture designs and placement options.
